# Checkers

Instructions for making this game is given in instructions.pdf

Introduction:
This is a checkers game developed in C++ by Junaid Saleem. It is a classic board game where two players take turns moving their pieces on an 8x8 grid. The game follows the standard rules of checkers, implementing the necessary functionalities using classes.

Instructions:
1. The game is played on an 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares, forming a checkerboard pattern.
2. Each player starts with twelve pieces placed on the dark squares closest to their edge of the board.
3. The pieces are differentiated by numbers 1 and 0 for red and black
4. Players take turns moving their pieces, with red making the first move.
5. Non-king pieces can move diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square.
6. Kings can move diagonally forward or backward to an adjacent empty square.
7. Jumping is allowed to capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally to the adjacent vacant square beyond.
8. Multiple jumps can be made in a single move, capturing multiple opponent's pieces, with the option to change directions.
9. When a piece reaches the last row (the King Row), it becomes a king and gains the ability to move and jump backward.
10. The game continues until one player is unable to move because they have no pieces left or all of their pieces are blocked.
11. Players can resign or agree to draws.

Note: This implementation does not include any graphical interface and is purely text-based.
